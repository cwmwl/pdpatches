IADG, or "Instant Ambient Drone Generator".
A sort of freeze/reverb effect based on delay lines.
You will need both files in the same directory. A graph-on-parent is provided if you want to use it in a larger patch or with a nicer GUI.
This is a mono in, stereo out version, with controls for the dry volume and the effect volume.
Feel free to modify and share this patch.
